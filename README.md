## Usage
  Perfect Pitch is a vocal training app that will graph the user's vocals and compare it against their favorite singer's vocals.
  On the far left of our app, there is a library of songs that the user can train their vocals. Once a song is clicked there will be
  four main features. The top left box in the main page is the pitch detector and it will tell you what note you are singing. In the
  top center is the audio controls which has the Play, Pause, and Stop buttons. It also has two volume controls. The top controls: controls
  the volume of the instrumental. The bottom one: controls the volume of the vocals. The bottom box will have the selected song's singer's
  vocals already graphed out and it will graph the user's vocals in real time.
